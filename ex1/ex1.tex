	\section{Multiplexing}
	\subsection*{a) Internet without Multiplexing}
	Without multiplexing, every single connection to a popular site would require a dedicated wire to that destination. If, for example, Google had a total of 500 incoming wires at a datacenter, a maximum of 500 users could connect to Google at any given time.
	\subsection*{b) TDM vs FDM}
	Time-division Multiplexing (TDM) works by compressing data into a smaller timeframe, buffering those packets and interleaving packets of multiple incoming connections on a shared high-bandwidth link before reconstructing them into multiple low-bandwidth connections again. In contrast to that, Frequency-division Multiplexing (FDM) actually transmits data from both connections at the same time, though on different, non-interfering frequencies over the same medium.
	\subsection*{c) CDM and SDM}
	Code Disivion Multiplexing is roughly analogous to FDM in a digital signal. It uses non-interfering modulation codes (orthogonal vectors) for different connections to transmit multiple data streams over a single connection.
  Space Division Multiplexing refers to modifying the spatial direction of a wireless transmission (e.g. of a cellular base station) to match the physical position of the receiving device, thereby limiting the amount of noise / interference that other devices are exposed to.
